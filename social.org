org-social.el 2 is looking awesome! Have to confess, this is the geekiest social I've ever used, but also the one that's the most interesting. Hope more emacs user will consider joining!

Auto-commit could probably be set up with magit and a hook? I'm also thinking of doing something like that currently, I feel like it should be possible in a relatively simple way. Will post about once I manage to get it up and running.

Testing out the one-command solution to push changes to my org-social file in one step......

This was done in elisp, which I'm not familiar enough with, so was done using ai. I'm surprised it works, but I'll probably not use it, unless I can write it for myself.

I'm not against /AI-assisted/ coding, but I'd rather not rely on something that's written almost entirely with AI by someone who is not familiar with the language (me in this case).

Started up my old 3DS this week after a long time, and played some Phantasy Star 0 - I can't say I have nostalgia for /this/ game or console in particular, as I've played this game for the first time ever maybe last year, when I also purchased this used console. I *do* however have nostalgia for old games in general, which is probably the reason why I enjoy playing this somewhat clunky sci-fi rpg every once in a while.

Not quite the same as Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst, but for someone like me who commutes a lot, it's a relaxing activity for when I'm too tired to spend the time with doing something productive.
