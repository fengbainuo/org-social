org-social.el 2 is looking awesome! Have to confess, this is the geekiest social I've ever used, but also the one that's the most interesting. Hope more emacs user will consider joining!

Auto-commit could probably be set up with magit and a hook? I'm also thinking of doing something like that currently, I feel like it should be possible in a relatively simple way. Will post about once I manage to get it up and running.

Testing out the elisp function that should auto-commit my social.org file upon saving - seems like it's not working.
